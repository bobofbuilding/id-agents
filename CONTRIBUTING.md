# Contributing to ID Agents

Thank you for your interest in contributing to ID Agents! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/id-agents.git`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Copy environment template: `cp env.example .env`
5. Configure your `.env` file with required API keys

## Development Setup

```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Run in development mode (watch for changes)
npm run dev

# Start the interactive CLI
npm run id-agents

# Run tests
npm test
```

## Project Structure

```

docs/                       # Documentation
configs/                    # Team configs, demos, agent library, standalone skills
plugins/                    # Claude Code plugins
tests/                      # Test files
```

The v3 library layout lives under `configs/`:

```text
configs/
  agents/
    <name>/                 # Claude-native entry with CLAUDE.md + optional extras
    <name>.md + <name>/     # AGENTS.md-native sibling pair
  skills/
    <name>/SKILL.md         # Standalone skill entry
  demos/                    # Example team YAMLs
```

## Making Changes

### Versioning and Publishing

ID Agents follows the same release-version schema as IDACC:

- `package.json` must carry the strict `X.Y.Z` version being published.
- `CHANGELOG.md` must include a `## [X.Y.Z]` heading for that version.
- The release commit subject must start with `vX.Y.Z: `.
- The release commit must be tagged `vX.Y.Z`.

`npm publish` runs `npm run verify:release-schema` through `prepublishOnly` before
building, so a release that does not match those fields fails before it is
published.

### Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow existing code patterns and naming conventions
- Keep functions focused and reasonably sized
- Add types for function parameters and return values

### Commits

- Write clear, concise commit messages
- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Reference issues when applicable

### Pull Requests

1. Create a feature branch from `main`
2. Make your changes
3. Run tests: `npm test`
4. Build to check for type errors: `npm run build`
5. Submit a pull request with a clear description

### Testing

- Add tests for new features
- Ensure existing tests pass
- Integration tests are in `tests/integration/`

## Areas for Contribution

- **Documentation**: Improve guides, add examples, fix typos
- **Bug fixes**: Check issues labeled `bug`
- **Features**: Check issues labeled `enhancement`
- **Tests**: Increase test coverage
- **Harnesses**: Add support for new LLM runtimes
- **Skills**: Create new agent skills

## Contributing Agent Library Entries

When adding or updating reusable library content:

- Put agent entries under `configs/agents/<name>/` using one of the two supported shapes:
  - Claude-native: `<name>/CLAUDE.md` plus optional `skills/`, `agents/`, `commands/`, `rules/`, `settings.json`, `hooks/`, `files/`
  - AGENTS.md-native: sibling `<name>.md` plus `<name>/` for extras
- Put standalone skills under `configs/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
- Keep `agent:` and `skills:` examples as peer fields in docs and sample configs
- Preserve upstream `LICENSE` files verbatim next to imported third-party skill content
- Update `NOTICE` when importing or redistributing third-party library content so attribution and license posture stay intact

If you are unsure whether imported content can be redistributed, do not rewrite or normalize it casually. Preserve the upstream files and document the license posture explicitly.

## Reporting Issues

When reporting bugs, please include:

- Steps to reproduce
- Expected behavior
- Actual behavior
- Environment details (OS, Node version)
- Relevant logs or error messages

## Code of Conduct

- Be respectful and inclusive
- Focus on constructive feedback
- Help others learn and grow
