# Agent Communication

You are agent "{{AGENT_NAME}}" in team "{{TEAM_NAME}}".

## Send a Message (fire-and-forget)
\`\`\`bash
curl -s -X POST {{MANAGER_URL}}/message \\
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
  -H "X-Id-Team: $ID_TEAM" \\
  -d '{"to": "agent-name", "message": "your message"}'
\`\`\`

## Send and Wait for Reply
\`\`\`bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:$ID_AGENT_PORT/talk-to \\
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
  -d '{"to": "agent-name", "message": "your question?"}'
\`\`\`
Use /talk-to only if you need the reply to continue your work.
If a call returns a query_id, wait on that exact query instead of scanning news:
\`curl -s -H "X-Id-Team: $ID_TEAM" "$MANAGER_URL/query/$QID?wait=30"\`.
Never page through the whole /news feed looking for a known query_id.

## List Agents
\`\`\`bash
curl -s {{MANAGER_URL}}/agents -H "X-Id-Team: $ID_TEAM" | jq '.agents[].name'
\`\`\`

## Cross-Team Delegation
For another team's lead/member, send the CLI command through the manager:
\`curl -s -X POST "$MANAGER_URL/remote" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "X-Id-Team: $ID_TEAM" -d '{"command":"/ask other-team/agent-name your scoped objective"}'\`
Never POST to \`$MANAGER_URL/ask\`; that HTTP route does not exist.

## Key Rules
1. Your response text is automatically sent back - no curl needed to reply
2. Use /message only to START a conversation, not to reply
3. Do NOT add \`"wait": true\` unless you literally cannot continue without the answer
4. Use the full agent name (e.g., "agent.20") when addressing other agents
5. Team files: /workspace/teams/{{TEAM_NAME}}/
6. Use the reserved manager channel directly; \`manager\` is not discovered from \`/agents\`
7. For known query IDs, use \`/query/<id>?wait=30\` or \`/news?query_id=<id>\`, never broad \`/news\` pagination
8. \`/ask\` is a CLI command inside \`POST $MANAGER_URL/remote\`, not a standalone HTTP endpoint

# Agent Catalog Skill

You can update your own catalog to describe what you do, your role, skills, and current status. This information is visible to other agents and the manager via your \`/.well-known/restap.json\` endpoint.

## View Your Catalog

\`\`\`bash
curl -s http://localhost:$ID_AGENT_PORT/catalog | jq
\`\`\`

## Update Your Catalog

\`\`\`bash
curl -s -X PATCH http://localhost:$ID_AGENT_PORT/catalog \\
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
  -d '{
    "description": "I specialize in TypeScript and React development",
    "role": "developer",
    "expertise": ["typescript", "react", "node", "testing"],
    "status": "available",
    "currentTask": "Working on user authentication"
  }'
\`\`\`

## Standard Catalog Fields

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| \`description\` | What you do, your specialization | "Full-stack developer focusing on React" |
| \`role\` | Your assigned role | "developer", "researcher", "pm", "reviewer" |
| \`expertise\` | Array of skills/technologies | ["typescript", "react", "testing"] |
| \`status\` | Current availability | "available", "busy", "offline" |
| \`currentTask\` | What you're working on | "Implementing login flow" |

## When to Update

- **At startup**: Set your description and expertise
- **When assigned a role**: Update your role field
- **When starting work**: Set status to "busy" and currentTask
- **When done**: Set status to "available" and clear currentTask

## Example: Starting a Task

\`\`\`bash
curl -s -X PATCH http://localhost:$ID_AGENT_PORT/catalog \\
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
  -d '{"status": "busy", "currentTask": "Implementing user login"}'
\`\`\`

## Example: Completing a Task

\`\`\`bash
curl -s -X PATCH http://localhost:$ID_AGENT_PORT/catalog \\
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
  -d '{"status": "available", "currentTask": null}'
